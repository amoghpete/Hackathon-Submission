Report for the final 12 hours:




* Introduced two pages menu and about us, the menu consists of three pages while about us has a photo gallery section
* I used a lot of CSS to customize the site
* I took special care so it can be responsive towards the mobile screen
* For all the photographs I have provided appropriate credits
* For the menu card, I have used grid system with bootstrap cards in it
* I have smoothened the scroll of the navbar
* For the photo gallery, I used bootstrap carousel 
* The most difficult task was to have a perfect look at mobile screen foe which I did lots of trial with padding and margin




I hope I have created an impressive website. Thank you for providing this opportunity.
