Report for the first 12 hours:


* I initially roughly picturized how the home page of the website should look.
* I decided not to go for any already available theme and try to make it from scratch
* So, for this first 12 hours, I tried only to built a skeletal structure of the page
* For this, I took the help of HTML and Bootstrap only
* I am using Visual Studio code editor for this
* During the entire coding, I kept using git so to understand the timeline of what I did.
* As of now, I have added a navbar with items that I felt I should include:
   * Home
   * Restaurant
   * Menu
   * And others(of which some might be deleted if I feel it’s hard to complete a separate web page for them in time
* The home page was given three jumbotrons for emphasizing the main content like:
   * List Attraction and call for table reservation
   * Ways to book and call for creating a menu
   * Other branches links and call for those who might want to know more about the restaurant’s history
* I will be adding cards with pictures later on
* Styling part is not started yet but I have clear goals about it how should it look
* For the footer part, I am using the grid layout where I added three columns for:
   * Contact/follow us part
   * Opening times
   * Google maps plugin
* I am thinking to make navbar and the footer in a separate file so I can use it for repetitively in other pages
* The 30 dishes problem statement had described won’t be on the home page. They can be accommodated in menu page
* Similarly About us will be covered in the restaurant page
* To talk about responsiveness, I am taking care of it by using containers and specifying position with respect to screen sizes
* I am aiming to give smooth transitions using CSS later on 
* As of now, I have not used any external photographs or codes so no credits to be given so far. Just I got a lot of help from Bootstrap documentation


Hopefully, in the next 12 hours, I could present a more appealing site to you. Till then you can see this
